    # Introduction

    When you go to McDonald's, you can order their popular Chicken McNuggets in various quantities. 
    In the past, you could purchase McNuggets in packs of 6, 9, and 20. Given that you could only order 
    in these quantities, there are quantities of McNuggets you would not be able to purchase. 
    For instance, you would not be able to order 5 or less McNuggets because 6 was the smallest quantity 
    that you could purchase. For this particular case, it turns out that you can order any quantity of McNuggets
    that is greater than :red[**43**]. We can use the following model to describe our situation:

    $6x + 9y + 20y = N$ 

    where
    * $x$: number of $6$ packs purchased
    * $y$: number of $9$ packs purchased
    * $z$: number of $20$ packs purchased
    * $N$: total number of McNuggets purchased
    
    Notes:
    * $x, y, z, N$ are all nonnegative integers.
    * $x, y, z$ are variables, while $N$ is a given.
    * The above equation will always have a solution if **N is greater than or equal to 44.**
